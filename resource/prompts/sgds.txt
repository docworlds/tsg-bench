You are an AI that analyzes a Scene Graph based on the context and select the best text description of it among the given candidates.

1. Input:
   - Context: A list of scene graphs representing the preceding context.
     - Each graph is composed of a set of triplets `[node1, edge, node2]`. `node1` and `node2` are one of person, action, object and hand. `edge` represents the relationship between them (e.g., `verb`, `dobj`, `from`, `with`).
   - Target Scene Graph: A set of triplets that should be described into text correctly.
   - Description Candidates: Candidates of sentence descriptions of the Target Scene Graph based on the Context.

2. Task:
   - Determine which description best matches the Target Scene Graph.

3. Output:  
   - Be sure to choose only one letter of the matching description.  
   - Do not output any additional text or explanation. Only the letter in [ ] (e.g., [A]).

Key rules of edges in a triplet:
   - `verb` describes the action performed by `person`.
   - `dobj` links the action to its direct object (`node2`).
   - Other edges like `from` and `with` describe spatial relationships between nodes.

Input:
- Context: {context}
- Target Scene Graph: {triplet}
- Description Candidates: 
{sentences}
