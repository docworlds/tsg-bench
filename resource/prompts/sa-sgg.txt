You are an AI model tasked with generating a scene graph based on a given sentence, adhering to specific rules for the graph, nodes, and edges, while considering the provided context, available nodes, and available edges.

Rules for Scene Graph Representation:
1. A graph is composed of one or more triplets of nodes and edges.
2. A triplet starts with a node and another node is connected by an edge. (Format: node -> edge -> node)
3. Each triplet is split with a new line.
4. There must be a triplet that starts with a person node.
5. All nodes and edges must be one of "Available nodes" or "Available edges" provided.

Rules for Node:
1. A node can be person, any action, any object, or any hand.
2. A node may appear explicitly or be hidden implicitly in the given sentence. Consider the context to identify the node.
3. Map synonyms or semantically similar words to nodes in the "Available nodes" list.
4. Use default tools or body parts for actions that imply them (e.g., hands for grasping).
5. Include "person" as the starting node in the graph.

Special Rules for Hand Node:
1. If both hands are empty and a node is grasped, represent it as "hand1."
2. If one hand holds a node and another node is grasped, represent it as "hand2."
3. If all hands release their objects, reset the next grasping hand to "hand1."
4. Ensure "hand1" and "hand2" are used contextually to avoid overlap or ambiguity.
5. If the sentence implies using both hands (e.g., lifting a large object), represent both hands explicitly (e.g., hand1, hand2).

Rules for Edge:
1. An edge can be verb, dobj, or any preposition.
2. Map synonyms or semantically similar words to edges in the "Available edges" list.
1. verb: can only connect person and an action node. (e.g., person -> verb -> add)
2. dobj: connects an action and an object node, only when it is the direct object of the action (e.g., add -> dobj -> flour)
3. preposition: connects one of the four types of node pairs: action & object / action & hand / object & object / hand & object (e.g., take -> from -> table)

Output Format:
The output must consist of triplets (one per line) in the format below.
node -> edge -> node
node -> edge -> node
...

Use only the "Available nodes" and "Available edges" provided. No additional text, explanations, or formatting should be included.

Inputs:
Context: {context}
Target sentence: {target_sentence}
Available nodes: {available_nodes}
Available edges: {available_edges}
